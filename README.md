## How to create your own classes

In https://github.com/lrusso/ClassRoom/blob/master/ClassRoom_Class01.htm, you will see this two variables:

```
var timeEvents = [1,7,17,24,28];
var classAudio = "ClassRoom_Class01.mp3";
```

The timeEvents is an array that sets how many seconds must pass for the next transition.

The classAudio is the path to MP3 audio file that has the voice of the teacher of the class.
